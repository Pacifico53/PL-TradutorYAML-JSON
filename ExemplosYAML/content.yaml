# <- yaml supports comments, json does not
# did you know you can embed json in yaml?
# try uncommenting the next line
# { foo: 'bar' }

json:
  - rigid
  - better for data interchange
yaml:
  - slim and flexible
  - better for configuration
content: |-
   Or we
   can auto
   convert line breaks
   to save space
object:
  key: value
  array:
    - null_value:
    - boolean: true
    - integer: 1
